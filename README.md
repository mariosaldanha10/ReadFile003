# ReadFile003

This code is written in C# and demonstrates how to read and write to files using the FileDemo class.

In this code, there are two arrays of strings containing names of DC and Marvel superheroes. The code calls the WriteDemo function of the FileDemo class to write these arrays to two separate files. Then, it calls the ReadDemo function to read the contents of the files and display them on the console.

After displaying the contents of the files, the code calls the SplitAsString function of the FileDemo class to split a long string into an array of characters. It then displays the character at a specific index of the array.

Overall, this code provides a basic example of how to read and write to files using C# and the FileDemo class.
